Nestlé is the largest food company in the world, marketing over

across 5 continents and employs over 200,000 employees
worldwide. As the World Food Company, Nestlé is the provider of
the best food for whatever time of day and for whatever time of your
life. Nestlé R&D Australia plays an important role in the
development of products for Nestlé Nutrition, with focus on creating
products with micronutrient fortification to address deficiencies.

The company wants to expand its business by adding new product
lines. However, the Head of Growth and Strategy suggested that it
was important to know the performance of the current products.
